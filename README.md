# Volightile

Experiment using the lighting effects from the [Unity Adam demo](https://unity3d.com/pages/adam). This project also features a plugin to control the aspect ratio of the main scene camera called [Auto Letterbox](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/56814). The song is called 'This is How it Ends'. You can listen to it on [soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/blurryroots/this-is-how-it-ends).
